# TODO

## Frontend

-   MyProgress > Sidebar component needs text alignment; icons are too thick; dashboard-banner div needs "active" styling

## Backend

-   Start a basic database that will help dynamically display ProgressCard tiles

# SIDE-TODOS

-   The Notification/Messaging Link will need to turn into a button that opens a dropdown of some sort unless otherwise noted. (Right now it's a Router Link and will probably not be used that way)
-   The Navbar component fights with the Sidebar component on the MyProgress Component. Main issue is that I can't figure out what the math is behind fitting it in properly. (So far, no problems, may not need to be changed)
